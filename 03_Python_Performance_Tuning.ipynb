    "*Deterministic profiling* is meant to reflect the fact that all function call, function return, and exception events are monitored, and precise timings are made for the intervals between these events (during which time the user’s code is executing). This is in contrast to *statistical profiling* which randomly samples the effective instruction pointer, and deduces where time is being spent. The latter technique traditionally involves less overhead (as the code does not need to be instrumented), but provides only relative indications of where time is being spent.\n",

Python automatically provides a hook (optional callback) for each event.

The result is that deterministic profiling is not that expensive, yet provides extensive run time statistics about the execution of a Python program.\n",

The `profile` module is written in Python, so has a much higher overhead, but is easier to extend. There is also a newer module, called `line_profiler` that profiles on a line-by-line basis.

    "The cProfile module shows how much time is being spent in each function. This is a good first step for locating hotspots in a program, and is frequently all that is needed to optimize the code. However, sometimes the cause of the hotspot is actually a single line in the function, and that line may not be obvious from just reading the source code. These cases are particularly frequent in scientific computing. Functions tend to be larger (sometimes because of legitimate algorithmic complexity, sometimes because the programmer is still trying to write FORTRAN code), and a single statement without function calls can trigger lots of computation when using libraries like NumPy. cProfile only times explicit function calls, not special methods called because of syntax. Consequently, a relatively slow NumPy operation on large arrays like this,\n",
